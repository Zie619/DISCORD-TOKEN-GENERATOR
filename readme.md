Hey everyone. for the couple of last months iv'e been working on my token generator, tweaking and fixing it.
currently it's working perfect and making around 300 valid full tokens in less then 10 min.
Right now i'm working on improving the solver from anti-captcha api to an AI solver to get the results even better (3x tokens then now)

the gen is on JS and works async not browser based so you can use it on any OS (tested on linux and windows) and run at least 100 nodes the same time- better pc
faster results - would help set it up for begginers.
I'm selling my gen as an app or source code - contact me on telegram:

selling only 10 units because I don't want it to get online and get patched. 

*NOT MAINTAINED*
